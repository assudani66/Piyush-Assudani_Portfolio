        Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that blends the real world with digital content. The distinction between virtual reality and augmented reality is that virtual reality creates an entirely new environment while augmented reality enhances the real world. AR development allows us to create apps that change our perception of the real world, to make it more engaging and entertaining.

      <h2>AR.js</h2>
      <p>
        You can use AR.js for building marker-based AR scenes. The tool comes with the A-Frame and the three.js extension that that works with any smartphone, regardless of its OS version. 

      </p>
      <h2>Aframe-ar</h2>
      <p>
        The best way to build mobile AR application is to use ARCore for Android and ARKit for iOS. In order to use these SDK’s capabilities on the web, you can use two experimental apps released by Google including WebARonARCore and WebARonARKit that allow a JavaScript API to work on the aforementioned capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of that, Google also released three.ar.js library with three.js helper functions that support you building AR scenes. Aframe-ar was created to use A-Frame wrapper. It’s so easy to change your A-Frame scene tag from <a-scene> to <a-scene ar>.
      </p>
      <h2>Aframe-xr</h2>
      <p>
        Aframe-xr built on three.xr.js and they both are created by Mozilla. It supports the WebXR Device API by using the webxr-polyfill. The main use of aframe-xr is that it allow you to build progressive experiences on your device. In short, it allows you to choose and switch between AR and VR easily.
